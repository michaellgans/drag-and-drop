# Drag and Drop with JavaScript

## Purpose

Ever since I began coding, I've always wanted to learn how to incorperate drag and drop mechanics into my applications.  Now that I'm entering my final trimester as a student at Atlas School, I'm challenging myself to learn the basics of drag and drop in a day by making a simple tic-tac-toe game.  By doing this, I should be able to expand on my knowledge and use this technique in more complicated ways for later projects!

## MVP

- A simple tic-tac-toe board in the middle that pieces "snap" into.
- Two players share the same window and take turns controlling the mouse.
- Pieces start in their respective containers at the beginning of the game and when the screen is refreshed, they go back into their containers.
- Pieces can be clicked on anywhere and the mouse stays there while dragging.
- Learn Drag and Drop.
- Learn TailwindCSS.

## Stretch Goals

- Pieces can be customized by color or shape?
- When someone wins a line appears?
- Keeps score?
